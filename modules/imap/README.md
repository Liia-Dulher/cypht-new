## IMAP

This module set allows you to read and manage messages in E-mail accounts using
the IMAP protocol. If you are using Cypht as a webmail program, you definitely
want this module set enabled. Cypht also supports accessing E-mail accounts
using POP3, however the POP3 protocol, and the features Cypht supports, are
inferior to IMAP.
